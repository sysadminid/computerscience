#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/H30yvJ_RHE0
#### Description:
The Automated Export of Grafana Panels to Google Sheets for Reporting project aims to simplify the often tedious and repetitive task of manually capturing Grafana dashboard visuals and exporting them to Google Sheets. Through automation powered by a Python script, users can seamlessly generate up-to-date reports without any manual intervention, improving both the efficiency and accuracy of their reporting process.

Grafana is widely used for real-time monitoring and data visualization across many industries, offering powerful insights into system performance, business metrics, and more. However, manually capturing dashboard snapshots for periodic reports can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially when dealing with large, complex dashboards with multiple panels. This project automates that process, allowing users to schedule and extract Grafana panels and store them in Google Sheets, making it easy to share, review, and collaborate on the latest data.

By integrating Grafana’s dynamic data visualization with the collaborative power of Google Sheets, this solution provides a robust, scalable way to streamline reporting workflows.

#### Key Features
- Automated Screenshot Capture: The script automates the capture of Grafana panels, eliminating the need for manual screenshotting.
- Google Sheets Integration: The captured screenshots are directly uploaded into Google Sheets, making them accessible for review, collaboration, and reporting.
- Google Drive Storage: All panel images are uploaded to Google Drive, ensuring that the images are stored securely and can be easily accessed for future reference.
- Real-time Data: Since Grafana dashboards reflect real-time data, the exported reports will always contain the most recent and up-to-date visuals.
- Efficient Reporting: This automation significantly reduces the time and effort needed to compile reports, making it ideal for teams or individuals who frequently need to share dashboard updates.

#### Project Flow
The process follows a simple yet powerful flow to ensure seamless integration between Grafana and Google Sheets.
```
==> Collect metadata from Grafana (Project Name, Virtual Machine Name) ==> Capture Grafana Panel One-by-One
  ==> Upload to Google Drive ==> Update to Google Spreadsheet
```
By integrating Grafana’s real-time monitoring capabilities with Google Sheets’ collaborative features, the project offers a seamless solution for data visualization and reporting.

#### Benefits of Automation
This automation addresses several challenges that organizations face when manually capturing and updating Grafana dashboards for reporting:

1. Time Savings.<br>
Manually capturing Grafana panel screenshots and updating reports can be highly time-consuming, especially for organizations that require frequent updates. By automating this process, users save significant time and can focus on higher-value tasks instead of repetitive manual work.
2. Improved Accuracy.<br>
Manual data capture can lead to errors, such as capturing the wrong panel, outdated information, or inconsistent formatting. Automating this task ensures that the correct panels are captured every time, eliminating human error and improving the accuracy of your reports.
3. Up-to-Date Reports.<br>
Since the process captures Grafana panels in real-time, the reports always reflect the latest data and system metrics. This is particularly valuable for time-sensitive reporting, where having the most recent information is critical for decision-making.
4. Enhanced Collaboration.<br>
Google Sheets is a widely used tool for collaboration, allowing teams to easily share, review, and comment on reports. By integrating Grafana panels into Google Sheets, this project leverages the collaborative features of Google Workspace, making it easier for teams to work together and stay informed.
5. Scalable and Flexible.<br>
The project is designed to be scalable, meaning it can handle multiple dashboards or large numbers of panels without compromising on performance. It can also be adapted to suit specific needs, such as capturing certain panels, adding metadata, or customizing the report layout.

#### Prerequisites
To run this project, you’ll need the following:

- Python 3.x: The script is written in Python, so make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.
- Google API Client Library: You’ll need to install the google-api-python-client package to interact with Google Sheets and Google Drive.
- Grafana API Token: You will need an API token from your Grafana instance to authenticate and access the required dashboards.
- Google API Credentials: Create and download a Google API credentials file to allow the script to upload files to Google Drive and update Google Sheets.

#### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Set up your Google API credentials.
4. Update the script with your Grafana API token and Google Sheets ID.
5. Run the script.
```
python automate_reporting.py
```

#### Future Improvements
While this project provides a solid foundation for automating Grafana panel exports, there are several areas for future improvement:
- Scheduled Automation: Integrating with a task scheduler (e.g., cron jobs) to automate the exports at regular intervals.
- Customizable Reports: Allowing users to customize the layout and format of the reports in Google Sheets.
- Support for Additional Data Types: Expanding the script to support not only screenshots but also data export from Grafana panels directly into Google Sheets.
- Notifications: Sending email or Slack notifications when a report is updated.

#### Conclusion
The Automated Export of Grafana Panels to Google Sheets project provides a practical, efficient solution for automating the process of capturing and reporting Grafana dashboard data. By integrating two widely used platforms—Grafana and Google Sheets—this project helps teams streamline their workflows, improve reporting accuracy, and enhance collaboration. Whether you’re monitoring system performance or creating business reports, this automation will save you time and effort, ensuring that your reports are always up-to-date and ready to share.
