This repository is a personal project to document my journey through the CS50 course by Harvard University and to share my solutions to the problem sets provided in the course.

Important Notes:

- The solutions in this repository are my own and reflect my learning process. They may not be the most optimal or the only correct way to solve the problems.
- Sharing or using these solutions inappropriately, such as submitting them as your own work, violates the spirit of learning and academic honesty.
- I highly encourage anyone following the course to try solving the problems independently before referring to external resources, including this repository.
- This repository is meant for educational purposes only and is not officially affiliated with or endorsed by Harvard University or the CS50 course.

If you are interested in computer science but don't know where to start, I recommend the CS50 course from Harvard University. Besides the quality of the course which is very good and always updated every year, they have very great lecturers especially a very great computer scientist, Prof. David J. Malan. I put the information about CS50 below and hope you enjoy the course as well.
